# alsarecorder
Script to trigger recording of all channels on ALSA sound card.
Uses zenity for a VERY primitive UI.

Instructions:
- build captureinfo.c and place somewhere in path (like /usr/bin)
- edit runrecorder.sh to change path where recordings are stored
- make runrecorder.sh runnable somehow
